## Note from the developer

- This is an alpha build
- This app is being developed and managed by just a single developer at the moment.
- Before the app can be released for widespread use, I require assistance in testing and feedback on hardware combinations that I do not have access to.
- Please feel free to contribute with issues or feature requests.
- You also agree with [HWiNFO's License Agreement](https://www.hwinfo.com/files/license.pdf) by using this application.
