# HIRD (a.k.a. HWiNFO Remote Display)
An open-source project built with C# and Flutter to view sensor stats on any mobile device.

Server is built using .NET 6 and the client for Android and iOS is built with Flutter. gRPC is used to communicate between the server and the client to provide data streaming with low bandwidth and overhead.
